Volumes, it's all about 3D volumes and nothing else.

- A paper has thicknes, ergo a paper is solid 3D - box. Granted, the thicknes i kind of ridiculous but it is there and that's what makes it useful. Thin, so you can stack megamucho information. Sooner or later a monkey will write down the nitty gritty stuff of it all on a paper, somewher.

- Every single image pixel is a 3D - point.
